# MarioKartWii-USB-Gecko-Item-Spy-GUI

A graphical user interface item spy that requires a USB Gecko inspired by the item spy interface that can be found in Mario Kart 7. I am not responsible if you get banned using this tool.

## Settings

**Dump Speed:** Dumps item data after every defined millisecond. It is set to 200ms by default to reduce lag.

**Item Box Buffer:** Enables the item box icon when the other player's item decision is occurring. It is on by default. Please note that turning it off would violate one of the rules on Wiimmfi which prohibits seeing items being obtained early.

**Highlight Main Player:** Highlights your player with a golden border instead of the standard grey.

**Background:** Allows you to choose a background for the item spy.

## Usage


1. Place the given cheat code into your gct or load one of the gcts with some gct loader of your choosing.
2. Boot up your game and wait until you are on the main menu of the game.
3. You may now run the program and connect after any point after the main menu of the game has loaded. Note that information in the item spy screen will not be displayed unless you are in a race. This interface is only designed for online play and may not work as intended offline.
